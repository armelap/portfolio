        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>
            When people ask me how my passion for the marketing industry began, my response is a blend of ‘I never
            planned it’ and ‘It was meant to be.’ From a young age, I was captivated by the art of storytelling, the
            power of photography, and human psychology. I was always curious about the ‘why’ behind people’s actions
            and decisions. This curiosity naturally led me to explore creative ways of connecting with others.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey truly began with my first job, where I eagerly took on small marketing projects. I quickly
            discovered that marketing and content creation were not just tasks—they were sources of immense joy and
            adrenaline for me. The thrill of seeing people engage with an idea born from my creativity was unlike
            anything I had ever experienced. At that moment, everything clicked, and I realized that this was my true
            calling.
        </p>
        <p>
            This passion has since blossomed into a series of enriching experiences in the marketing field, shaping who
            I am today. I am Armela, but my friends and family call me ‘Mela,’ which means ‘apple’ in Italian.
